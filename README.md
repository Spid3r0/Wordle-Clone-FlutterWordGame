# Wordle Clone (Word Game On Flutter)

Word finder game I developed to test my experience with Flutter. I tried to develop a clone of the worldwide popular wordle application on the mobile platform.

- [To Acceess Orginal Game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)


I created an offline build that can be played over and over again with its animations. I set up a small-scale data with 5-letter words I found on the web-sources.

<img src="/pictures/img2.png" width=30% height=30%>
<img src="/pictures/img3.png" width=30% height=30%>
 
</p>

The score is saved on the leaderboard page and you can track your winnings or losses from there.
